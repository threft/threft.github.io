<!-- The Threft Interface Definition Language looks a lot like the original thrift one, but is a lot stricter. Some posibilities are removed from the spec. -->

<span class="label label-info">TODO</span>
My current approach to this is to implement the thrift parser into the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/threft/threft/tree/master/tidm" >tidm package</a> and write down all things I like/dislike. I will then proceed to create a threft-idl spec draft and place it here.

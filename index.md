Welcome at Threft.io.
The Threft.io project is created to provide [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org)-like functionality, rewriten from scratch. The goal is to generate code that is compatible with popular Thrift serialisation formats, while using a different approach in design for the parser, generator, support libraries and generated code. Most parts of the project will be written in the [go](https://golang.org) language, although this project will allow anyone to easily write a generator plugin in any language.
